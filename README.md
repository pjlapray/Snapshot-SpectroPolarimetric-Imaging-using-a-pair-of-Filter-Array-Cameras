# Spectral-and-Polarimetric-database
A database of spectral and polarimetric images acquired from stereoscopic acquisition system in visible region.
If you use images from this dataset, please cite the following paper:

"S. Sattar, P.-J. Lapray, L. Aksas, A. Foulonneau & L. Bigué, 
“Snapshot SpectroPolarimetric Imaging using a pair of Filter Array Cameras“, 
Opt. Eng. (2022)."

The folder name "Data" contains "y" images acquired from the left CPFA camera with GG475 yellow filter. The right images with name "bg" are captured using the right CPFA camera with a BG-39 blue-green filter. 

The images are pre-processed geometrically (until subsection 3.1 in the paper). The images are stored with name as depicted in Figure 8 of the paper.
There are multipage tif files, the four pages correspond to 0, 45, 90, and 135 polarization angles respectively.

For Stokes, reflectance, and color transforms, the Matlab scripts are given with respective title. 
Please respect the order of script execution indicated by the numbers.
